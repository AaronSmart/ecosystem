<b>NoGoalFaces</b>
NoGoalFaces is a collection of only 512 randomly generated dumb faces NFTs. Their metadata is permanently stored on Arweave and is Metaplex compatible. Each face (512x512 pixels) is the combination of 11 layers and 70+ attributes, for a total possibility of over 20 million unique faces! All attributes have rarity levels: Common (default attribute), Uncommon (20% chance), Rare (10%), Epic (4%) and Legendary (1%).

The memetoken was airdropped to 22,785 unique addresses everywhere across the world, mostly without any token holding requirements, making of it one of the largest and most equitable Solana airdrop yet!
